          After upgrading my system to Ubuntu 11.04 I was no longer able to establish a VPN connection. Shrew Soft VPN would time out. It appears that the Reverse Path Filter was causing the issue.
Found the following solution:
Edit your network-security.conf to disable the Reverse Path Filter:
sudo vim /etc/sysctl.d/10-network-security.conf Set the following items from 1 to 0:
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0 net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0 Save and perform the following command.
sudo /sbin/sysctl -p

          Configuring site to site VPN using two m0n0wall boxes is a snap.
There are a couple of things you will want to know ahead of time.
 The IP address or FQDN of both firewalls WAN interface. Internal subnet of both networks. The shared key (password).  Log into your firewall and head to the VPN/IPSec section. Click the + sign to get started. Assuming you are connecting two boxes across the internet, set the Interface to &amp;ldquo;WAN&amp;rdquo;.
