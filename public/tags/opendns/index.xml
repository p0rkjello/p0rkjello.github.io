          Looking for a method of using OpenDNS with a dynamic IP address. I am using the DynDNS service however there is no method of linking this service to OpenDNS. OpenDNS has an additional service called DNS-O-Matic.
DNS-O-Matic is a dynamic DNS service. The service supports dozens of other dynamic DNS services. All of which can be linked to your account. A list of the supported services can be found below.
