          Citrix users are receiving an error on login.
The Citrix server is reporting a number of Event ID: 118 errors.
Open the Terminal Services Manager and check for disconnected listeners. In my case the ICA Listener was down (disconnected). Resetting the listener resolved the issue.

          I ran into an issue with some Citrix servers in the environment. Users were getting a protocol driver error. After poking around I noticed ICA was not listening on port 1494.
It appears that this issue was caused by Microsoft patch MS12-024.
