          While searching for a quick method of checking a systems memory type, I stumbled upon the dmidecode tool. Dmidecode was able to pull all of the memory information from my motherboard. Including open memory slots and values of the occupied ones.
Usage Usage: dmidecode [OPTIONS] Options are: -d, --dev-mem FILE Read memory from device FILE (default: /dev/mem) -h, --help Display this help text and exit -q, --quiet Less verbose output -s, --string KEYWORD Only display the value of the given DMI string -t, --type TYPE Only display the entries of given type -u, --dump Do not decode the entries --dump-bin FILE Dump the DMI data to a binary file --from-dump FILE Read the DMI data from a binary file -V, --version Display the version and exit dmidecode run without any options will dump everything it can determine from the Desktop Management Interface (dmi).

          apt-get is the package management utility behind Debian-based Linux systems Ubuntu, Mint and Mepis.
A complete list of distributions based on Debian can be found on Distrowatch.
Basic Package Management: apt-get update
Used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and scans the Packages.gz files, so that information about new and updated packages is available.

So I managed to uninstall my kernel In an effort to get VMware Workstation running I needed to downgrade my kernel. I installed the new kernel and got everything setup. Sometime later the system reverted to the newer version.
I already had the package exclusion IgnorePjg = linux, linux-headers in pacman.conf. So I decided to purge the newer kernel 3.16 from the system. After doing so, I reinstalled the downlevel kernel 3.

          Arch Linux Powerpill Setup Powerpill is a wrapper for Archlinux package management tool, pacman. This is a short tutorial on setting up powerpill for concurrent downloads without using the reflector.
 Powerpill is a wrapper script written by Xyne for pacman that speeds up package retrieval by using aria2c for concurrent/segmented downloads. It determines the target packages of requested synchronization operation and then uses the mirrorlist to create a comprehensive metalink.

          Bash version 4 introduced a new option called globstar. When the option is set, recursive globbing with ** is enabled.
Lets say you want to move all files from a directory and its subdirectories. Most common method would be to use the find command.
For example, find and move all .mp3 files from the current and all subdirectories to a directory named music.
$ sudo find . -type f -exec mv *.

          Batch convert image files with ImageMagick I recently had a number of SVG images that needed to be converted to PNG. There are a few applications that are capable of converting (Gimp, Photoshop, etc). However I wanted something simple that could batch convert them. Little did I know I already had it installed. The application is called ImageMagick.
mogrify -format png *.svg There are an incredible number of options available. Head on over to the ImageMagick site for more details.

BOINC - Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing BOINC is a distributed [grid] computing client that uses idle time on your computer. There are a number of projects that you can attach to and assist with. I will cover how to connect to the World Community Grid via CLI on Ubuntu.
World Community Grid
 World Community Grid&amp;rsquo;s mission is to create the world&amp;rsquo;s largest public computing grid to tackle projects that benefit humanity.

          As of version 7.0.40 BOINC has the ability to split GPU tasks across multiple work units.
 Preliminary Change Log 7.0.39 &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; 7.0.40:
client: add &amp;ldquo;client app configuration&amp;rdquo; feature; seeÂ  This lets users do the following:
 limit the number of concurrent jobs of a given app (e.g. for WCG apps that are I/O-intensive) Specify the CPU and GPU usage parameters of GPU versions of a given app.   BOINC development versions are found here: http://boinc.

          After upgrading my system to Ubuntu 11.04 I was no longer able to establish a VPN connection. Shrew Soft VPN would time out. It appears that the Reverse Path Filter was causing the issue.
Found the following solution:
Edit your network-security.conf to disable the Reverse Path Filter:
sudo vim /etc/sysctl.d/10-network-security.conf Set the following items from 1 to 0:
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0 net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0 Save and perform the following command.
sudo /sbin/sysctl -p

 Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells. Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64(ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions between windows.

 Promiscuous mode
When running network monitoring tools, e.g., tcpdump, it is common to enable promiscuous mode on the device, so that all traffic is seen (instead of seeing only traffic destined for the local host).

          SATA Wanted Many of the public CentOS Vagrant boxes are configured with only an IDE controller. I assume this is for compatibility reasons. The SATA controller on VirtualBox performs better, so that is what I want.
Serial ATA (SATA)
 Like a real SATA controller, Oracle VM VirtualBox&amp;rsquo;s virtual SATA controller operates faster and also consumes fewer CPU resources than the virtual IDE controller. Also, this enables you to connect up to 30 virtual hard disks to one machine instead of just three, when compared to the Oracle VM VirtualBox IDE controller with a DVD drive attached.

GNOME Shell takes advantage of the capabilities of modern graphics hardware and introduces innovative user interface concepts to provide a delightful and easy to use experience.
Availability and Status
The GNOME Shell is currently in active development and while many planned features are not yet implemented it is stable enough for everyday use.

 Powerline is a statusline plugin for vim, and provides statuslines and prompts for several other applications, including zsh, bash, tmux, IPython, Awesome and Qtile.

          Solarized is a beautiful color palette. The palette was designed for readability and comes with both light and dark options.
 Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this color scheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions.

          I use these setting on a laptop with a Core 2 Duo and 4 GB of ram. It might seem like overkill to tweak this system. However since it is a work machine at any time I am running Lotus Notes, VirtualBox, OpenOffice, Chrome, etc. Should you have a system with limited resources I would recommend Xubuntu for a light full-featured DE. Another option and very light on resources would be any of the open|flux|blackbox window managers.

          Unrar Multiple Files Not something you run into everyday. However when you need to unrar multiple files in a directory, the following command is handy:
$ find -type f -name &amp;#39;*.rar&amp;#39; -exec unrar x {} \;

          While recklessly installing/testing some new themes I broke my GUI. Nothing seemed to be working right. After rebooting the box I was sitting at a blank screen. A quick check of ps -aux showed Gnome and Xorg running. What gives?
Fired up journalctl and saw a bunch of these listed. Yep that looks like a place I might have screwed up.
