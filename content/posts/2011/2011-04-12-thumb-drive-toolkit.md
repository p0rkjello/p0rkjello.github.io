A Windows Administrator USB toolkit. The following is a collection of free and/or open source tools I like to keep on hand.
## [Portable Apps collection](http://portableapps.com)

An useful set of tools made my [Mark Russinovich](http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/about.aspx) now available through Microsoft. Take some time and browse through the available tools. I find I use the Sysinternal tools almost everyday. Not sure how someone would administer Windows without them.

[Sysinternals Suite](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062)
The entire set of Sysinternals Utilities rolled up into a single download.
[PsTools](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649")
The PsTools suite includes command-line utilities for listing the processes running on local or remote computers, running processes remotely, rebooting computers, dumping event logs, and more.

Keep your Sysinternals tools up to date with using a [Portable Apps](http://portableapps.com/) compatible tool [WSCC](http://www.kls-soft.com/wscc/index.php)

Found a nice batch file to keep your Sysinternals tools updated over at [SysadminGeek.com](http://www.howtogeek.com/50356/batch-script-to-auto-update-sysinternals-tools/)

MS recently added Sysinternals Live. Description below from their site.

[Sysinternals Live](http://live.sysinternals.com/)

> Sysinternals Live is a service that enables you to execute Sysinternals tools directly from the Web without hunting for and manually downloading them. Simply enter a tool's Sysinternals Live path into Windows Explorer or a command prompt as [http://live.sysinternals.com/](http://live.sysinternals.com/) or live.sysinternals.comtools.

> You can view the entire Sysinternals Live tools directory in a browser at [http://live.sysinternals.com](http://live.sysinternals.com/).

## [Darik's Boot And Nuke](href="http://www.dban.org/)

> Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot disk that securely wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically and completely delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect, which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data destruction.

If you deal with server decomisions on a regular basis, this is an invaluable tool. This bootable image will allow your to perform a DOD compliant drive wipe.

Any additional tools you must have on hand?
