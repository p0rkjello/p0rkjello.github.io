Communicate clearly using the Nato phonetic alphabet background. It is difficult to accurately convey an asset tag, serial number, model number, etc to a peer or offsite support. Aside from phone clarity there is often accent or language barriers.

If you are using a Microsoft Windows OS you can quickly add the Nato phonetic alphabet to your desktop background. Grab a copy of the [Sysinternals](href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb545021) tool [Bginfo](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897557).
Then download the [nato.bgi](/assets/download/windows/nato.bgi) configuration file.
