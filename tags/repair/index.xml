Ran into a problem with my Lenovo T400. The laptop would not power on. No lights of any kind. Tried with and without the battery and/or AC adapter. Found these instructions while searching around for a solution:
Ensure nothing is plugged into the computer Remove the battery Press power button 10 times Press power button down for 30 seconds Press power button twice Attach ac adapter Press power button once. PC should come up.</description></item><item><title>Warning failed to load theme</title><link>https://p0rkjello.github.io/warning-failed-to-load-theme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://p0rkjello.github.io/warning-failed-to-load-theme/</guid><description>
While recklessly installing/testing some new themes I broke my GUI. Nothing seemed to be working right. After rebooting the box I was sitting at a blank screen. A quick check of ps -aux showed Gnome and Xorg running. What gives?
Fired up journalctl and saw a bunch of these listed. Yep that looks like a place I might have screwed up.
