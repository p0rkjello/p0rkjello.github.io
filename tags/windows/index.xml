System Writer is missing from the output of vssadmin list writers. The Application Event log is showing Event ID 513 source CAPI2.
Had a hell of a time resolving this issue. Most of the sources point to a permissions issue. However the security log remains error free. The script below is combines a couple suggested fixes. One of the fixed is from the Microsoft KB article 2009272.

Communicate clearly using the Nato phonetic alphabet background. It is difficult to accurately convey an asset tag, serial number, model number, etc to a peer or offsite support. Aside from phone clarity there is often accent or language barriers.
If you are using a Microsoft Windows OS you can quickly add the Nato phonetic alphabet to your desktop background. Grab a copy of the Sysinternals tool Bginfo. Then download the nato.</description></item><item><title>Persistent static route via Windows registry</title><link>https://p0rkjello.github.io/persistent-static-route-via-windows-registry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://p0rkjello.github.io/persistent-static-route-via-windows-registry/</guid><description>
For whatever reason I was unable to set a static route via the route command. I assume the system was pending a reboot. However I did not have the time to schedule the outage.
So I added the route directly to the registry. Problem solved, next.
Persistent static routed are stored in the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip \Parameters\PersistentRoutes
Add a new String Value with the name destination,mask,gateway,metric

Found a great script for removing ghosted (hidden) NICS on Frank Peter&amp;rsquo;s blog.
Using the Microsoft devcon.exe tool the script compares the output of find and findall. If the matching device count is not equal the additional device is removed.
find - Find devices that match the specific hardware or instance ID. findall - Find devices including those that are not present. The Device Console Utilitu (DevCon) is available from support.</description></item><item><title>Restart Terminal Services without rebooting</title><link>https://p0rkjello.github.io/restart-terminal-services-without-rebooting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://p0rkjello.github.io/restart-terminal-services-without-rebooting/</guid><description>

For those note aware of the GNU Tail utility, it will print the last n lines of text from a file. It is an invaluable tool for monitoring log files.
Since Windows does not have an equivalent command this is quite useful. Using the Powershell Get-Content cmdlet will print the contents of a file. The -wait parameter will print additional lines as they are added.
