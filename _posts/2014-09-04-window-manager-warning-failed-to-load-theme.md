While recklessly installing/testing some new themes I broke my GUI.
Nothing seemed to be working right. After rebooting the box I was sitting at a blank screen. A quick check of `ps -aux` showed Gnome and Xorg running. What gives?

Fired up `journalctl` and saw a bunch of these listed.
Yep that looks like a place I might have screwed up.

```console
gnome-session[7460]: Window manager warning: Failed to load theme "Adwaita": Failed to find a valid file for theme Adwaita
gnome-session[7460]: Window manager warning: Failed to load theme "Simple": Failed to find a valid file for theme Simple

```

I quick Google search found a recommendation to reinstall the gnome-themes-standard package.

```shell
$ sudo pacman -Sy gnome-themes-standard
```

The package spit out a couple warnings..

```console
pacman[7583]: warning: directory permissions differ on /usr/share/themes/Adwaita/backgrounds/
          filesystem: 766  package: 755

          filesystem: 766  package: 755
```

ok.. someone fat fingered the permissions.

```shell
$ sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/share/themes
$ sudo systemctl restart display-manager
```

Everything is back to normal.. The take away is use **~/.themes** or be more careful. :)
