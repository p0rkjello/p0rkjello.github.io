Ran into a problem with my Lenovo T400. The laptop would not power on. No lights of any kind. Tried with and without the battery and/or AC adapter. Found these instructions while searching around for a solution:

* Ensure nothing is plugged into the computer
  * Remove the battery
  * Press power button 10 times
  * Press power button down for 30 seconds
  * Press power button twice
  * Attach ac adapter
  * Press power button once. PC should come up. Perform normal start up. Everything should be fine.
* Shut down and reinstall the battery

Worked like a charm.
