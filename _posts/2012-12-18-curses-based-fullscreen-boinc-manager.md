Do you have a couple boxes running headless or otherwise not running Xorg? If you ever wanted to or had the need there is a Curses based [BOINC](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/) manager. The project name is Boinctui and is available on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/boinctui/).

Boinctui source code along with deb and rpm binaries are available for download.

    wget http://code.google.com/p/boinctui/downloads/detail?name=boinctui_1.0.0-0_i386.deb
    sudo dpkg -i boinctui_1.0.0-0_i386.deb
