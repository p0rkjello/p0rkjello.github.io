System Writer is missing from the output of `vssadmin list writers`. The Application Event log is showing Event ID 513 source CAPI2.

Had a hell of a time resolving this issue. Most of the sources point to a permissions issue. However the security log remains error free.
The script below is combines a couple suggested fixes. One of the fixed is from the Microsoft KB article [2009272](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2009272). Other items were found in various forums.

Either run the script as is or break it down in parts to show the exact issue. Be sure to restart the cryptographic service if not running the script in its entirety.
