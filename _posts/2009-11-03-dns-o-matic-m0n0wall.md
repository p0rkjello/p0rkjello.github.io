Looking for a method of using [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com) with a dynamic IP address. I am using the DynDNS service however there is no method of linking this service to OpenDNS. OpenDNS has an additional service called [DNS-O-Matic](http://www.dnsomatic.com).

DNS-O-Matic is a dynamic DNS service. The service supports dozens of other dynamic DNS services. All of which can be linked to your account. A list of the supported services can be found below.

For instance you can use DNS-O-Matic to update your DynDNS and OpenDNS accounts.

Thanks goes out to the editor of the thread below. DNS-O-Matic service can be used on m0n0wall without an "official" option for the service.
