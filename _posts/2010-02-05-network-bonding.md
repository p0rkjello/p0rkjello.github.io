Details on setting up network bonding. This is going to be used as a Snort sensor on a passive network tap.

Install ifenslave

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install ifenslave
```

Create the file `/etc/modprobe.d/bonding.conf` with the following:

```console
alias bond0 bonding
options bonding mode=0 miimon=100
```

A note about promiscuous mode regarding the bonding mode:

> **Promiscuous mode**
>
> When running network monitoring tools, e.g., tcpdump, it is common to enable promiscuous mode on the device, so that all traffic is seen (instead of seeing only traffic destined for the local host). The bonding driver handles promiscuous mode changes to the bonding master device (e.g., bond0), and propagates the setting to the slave devices.
>
> For the balance-rr, balance-xor, broadcast, and 802.3ad modes, the promiscuous mode setting is propagated to all slaves.
>
> For the active-backup, balance-tlb and balance-alb modes, the promiscuous mode setting is propagated only to the active slave.

Time to load the module:

```shell
$ sudo modprobe bonding
```

Add the new interface into your `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

```console
auto bond0
iface bond0 inet manual
slaves eth2 eth3
up ifconfig $IFACE 0.0.0.0 up
up ip link set $IFACE promisc on
down ip link set $IFACE promisc off
down ifconfig $IFACE down
```

Restart networking to bring up the new interface:

```shell
$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
```

Connect to your passive ethernet tap and verify with tcpdump

```shell
$ sudo tcpdump -i bond0
```
