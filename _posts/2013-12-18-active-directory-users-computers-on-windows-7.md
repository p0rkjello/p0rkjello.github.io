Download the [Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7887).

Note: Windows 7 Professional or better.

Install the software then run the follow commands to enable the AD Users & Computer snapin.

```console
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:RemoteServerAdministrationTools
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:RemoteServerAdministrationTools-Roles
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:RemoteServerAdministrationTools-Roles-AD
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:RemoteServerAdministrationTools-Roles-AD-DS
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:RemoteServerAdministrationTools-Roles-AD-DS-SnapIns
```

I received an error when trying to install the snapin directly.

```console
c:\>dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:RemoteServerAdministrationTools-Roles-AD-DS-SnapIns

Error: 50

The operation completed but RemoteServerAdministrationTools-Roles-AD-DS-SnapIns feature was not enabled.

```

Per the error message, install one component at a time.
